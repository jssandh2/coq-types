# TYPES 
* A repository containing an implementation of certain Types (such as Nat, Bool, etc.) in Coq, with Theorems and Functions

## REPOSITORY
* [coq-types](https://github.com/jssandh2/coq-types)

## STRUCTURE
### Directories
* Each `Type` is implemented in a _separate_ directory inside :
    * Bool : `src/Bool/*`
    * Nat : `src/Nat/*`


### Functions
* Each type is implemented, with functions that are _verified_ using `Example` **and** `Proof`
* The majority of the code is inspired from [**Software Foundations**](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html), and therefore, there is significant overlap in the code. However, the main idea here is to solve the Exercises and reimplement certain functions on my own
